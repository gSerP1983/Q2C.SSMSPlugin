Building MSI with Wix# is quite simple. But first you need prepare your building environment: 
Download (and extract) Wix# binaries from the Downloads section. You may but don’t have to download WiX as Wix# package already contains compatible copy of WiX.
Create environment variable WIXSHARP_WIXDIR pointing to the WiX ‘bin’ folder
- you can do it either manually. Normally the ‘bin’ path is “<WixSharp>\Wix_bin\bin”
- or you can just execute install.cmd from the Wix# package
You will need to ensure that WIXSHARP_WIXDIR was roperly creates as otherwise Wix# may not be able to find WiX compilers.
